### Boeing 737 Case Study

The 2018-2019 Boeing 737 MAX plane crashes are an excellent case study for observing failures in regulatory redundancy, enforcement of ethical practices in engineering practices, and navigating the complex social network in managing safety expectations. Through blatant objections to industry-wide transparency and a closed-minded corporate structure, the Boeing company created a crisis in the air travel industry by manufacturing faulty equipment and software, in particular, the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) software for the Boeing 737 MAX. The 737 MAX’s MACS was a known faulty system that raised repeated internal flags across different engineering and testing teams for causing serious aircraft failures. However, due to competitive pressures from Airbus, the 737 MAXes were pushed to market, leading to a combined death toll of 346 people from Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. The following is a thorough analysis of the engineering process made available through mainstream reporting, government audits, corporate whistleblowers, identifying the corporate/ internal regulatory failures at Boeing and improvements in private airline manufacturer workflows to limit the occurrence of these scandals.

### Corporate Engineering

For engineering teams, one of the largest scandals associated with the Boeing company involved the active suppression of testing failures with the MCAS system. New technology introduced to aircraft technology is generally subject to scrutiny and oversight through the five-phase aircraft certification framework from the FAA. The five phases include detailed and clear documentation on the conceptual design, requirements definitions, compliance planning, implementation, and authorization pathway to certify the safety of new technology. However, these steps were intentionally side-stepped by Boeing engineers during development, and according to a summary report from the FAA after the initial plane crashes, 7 major safety violations were identified that were likely to be flagged by regulators in the initial regulatory framework (FAA, 2020). Additionally, during development testing in the field, Boeing engineers, including Curtis Ewbank, spoke with the NYT regarding instances of Boeing engineering directors intentionally disregarding cockpit system failures during testing of MCAS and actively petitioned for transparency within regulatory documentation (Kitroeff, 2019). Despite the vast array of stakeholders involved with these projects, including design engineers, manufacturers, pilots, etc., there is no redundancy in the corporate decision-making that oversees unsafe practices that bottleneck through directors' choices.   

One major improvement would be greater engagement from aeronautics unions such as the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA). From a surface-level analysis, employees maintain awareness of the environment of anti-consumer practices and Boeing, but are limited in enacting effective internal resolution, given the profit incentives for upper-level management. As such, a form of collective bargaining  may be required to include additional methods of open engagement from lower-level engineers and manufacturers. This would be an arduous process, considering Boeing’s long-standing anti-union practices within the last decade, as noted by The Guardian (Sainato, 2019)

### Self-Regulation

For the internal regulatory team, the scandal exposed the laissez-faire attitude of FAA representatives and Boeing employees in ensuring the protection of public safety. Although the engineering teams are responsible for the active suppression of core documentation, regulators' blind eye towards these new technologies exposed the quid pro quo relationship of powerful groups with vested interests. Through the Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program, FAA duties were granted to internal Boeing employees who hold responsibilities towards the company’s shareholders as opposed to public safety. This relationship was solely responsible for establishing the revolving door between external FAA regulators and industry employees. One that led to nearly 200 incident reports being ignored by the FAA during the 737 MAX production, according to CNN (Devine, 2019).   

One major improvement would be more rigorous, frequent, and independently-led government audits, as outlined by Congress’s CSR labeled “Federal Aviation Administration Oversight of Boeing” (Elias, 2024). Despite the Boeing company undergoing 100s of audits from Boeing employees and FAA representatives, more redundancies should be added with non-corporate members to ensure truthfulness and accuracy. Another major is to encourage our representatives to push CFRs that limit the quid-pro-quo relationship between the government and industry. In a corporate landscape where non-competes are still legal after a direct banning from the previous FTC Chair Lina Khan in 2024 (FTC, 2024), there should be a realistically enforceable prohibition on the revolving door of employees from the US government and private industries through an expansion of 5 CFR Part 2641. 5 CFR Part 2641 creates the framework for limiting post-government employment conflicts of interest; however, it is extremely limited in terms of clarity and scope. Through an expansion of this principle, greater scrutiny is enforceable for these types of relationships.

### Key Takeaways

Given air travel is a natural monopoly, the only effective methods for limiting future failures of corporate oversight are through aggressive government policy and enforced regulatory redundancies. From greater union engagement to an expansion of specific CFRs to prevent revolving door relationships between the government and industry, there are numerous measures to limit such atrocities in the future. The ASMEs outline ethical practices such as competence and respect for others, none of which are upheld where engineers do not hold negotiating power and integrity in corporate structures.
