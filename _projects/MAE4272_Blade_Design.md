Project Overview

As a part of Cornell’s Fluid and Heat Transfer Laboratory, I developed a design process for optimizing the performance of a turbine blade with other mechanical engineering students. Our process leveraged 300+ lines of MATLAB-based simulations to determine ideal geometric parameters such as chord distribution and twist to maximize power output without structural failure. Our designs were printed with SLA Resin printers and assembled into small-scale turbines (R ~ 6 inches) and tested in a wind tunnel to quantify aerodynamic efficiency with turbine power curves.

Design Process

The major design constraints for the turbine blade included geometric limitations (Length < 6 inches, Longest Downstream Length < 2 inches, etc.), performance metrics (maximum operating speed < 2000 RPM), and material strength. With this in mind, our group created an iterative MATLAB simulation that discretized the blade as 7 simplified, thin-rectangular structures and altered the chord length/pitch of the elements. This created an effective simulation of the operating efficiency of different blade designs, more specifically, estimating the output torque (in N*m) of various blade designs. Our group selected a blade that maximized power output without exceeding the ultimate stress of the blade’s material (with an additional 1.5 factor of safety), and proceeded to model the blade in Fusion360. With the pitch and chord length of the respective elements, the blade was designed with discrete NACA 4412 profiles and combined to create a smoothed, continuous blade.

Testing Summary

Three wind turbine blades were produced with SLA manufacturing and assembled into a Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT). The singular turbine was fixed in the center of a typical low-velocity wind tunnel at Cornell University and connected to a data acquisition system (DAQ) powered by LabVI. Over several trials, the free-stream velocity of the wind tunnel was used to induce free rotational spin, which was quantified with an IR sensor for rotational RPM. With a torque brake applied to the horizontal axis of the turbine, the turbine's rotational rate was reduced by increasing the power to the torque brake. Each of these discrete increases in power was recorded with respect to the turbine’s steady-state rotation. Across several different free-stream velocities, the data were compiled to create power curves quantifying the turbine’s overall performance within a 2.75 m/s to 7.40 m/s range. The maximum torque generated by the blade was approximately 1.920 oz-in at about 1973 RPM, meeting the preset constraints of the design.

Contributions

My specific contributions for this project spanned across all of the stages of the blades development, including the initial assembly of the MATLAB simulation, creating the Fusion360 CAD and rendering, setting up and leading the execution of the blade performance experiment, and creating the output graphs quantifying performance. In addition, I led the compilation of the final design report and group presentation for the MAE 4272 laboratory staff.
